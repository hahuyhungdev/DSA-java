# Comparison of Static Array and Dynamic Array

## Comparison Table

| Operation    | Static Array      | Dynamic Array     |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Access       | \( O(1) \)        | \( O(1) \)        |
| Search       | \( O(n) \)        | \( O(n) \)        |
| Insert       | N/A               | \( O(n) \)        |
| Append       | N/A               | \( O(1) \)        |
| Delete       | N/A               | \( O(n) \)        |

## Detailed Analysis

1. **Access**:
   - **Static Array**: Accessing any element in a static array has a time complexity of \( O(1) \). This is because the elements are stored consecutively in memory and can be calculated and accessed using a simple arithmetic operation based on the index.
   - **Dynamic Array**: Similar to static arrays, accessing any element in a dynamic array also has a time complexity of \( O(1) \) since elements are stored consecutively in memory.

2. **Search**:
   - **Static Array**: To search for an element in a static array, one must traverse through all the elements (in the worst case), hence the time complexity is \( O(n) \).
   - **Dynamic Array**: Similar to static arrays, searching in a dynamic array also has a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

3. **Insert**:
   - **Static Array**: It's not possible to insert a new element into a static array as its size is fixed upon initialization. Hence, this operation is not applicable (N/A).
   - **Dynamic Array**: Inserting an element into a dynamic array may require shifting other elements to make space for the new element, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

4. **Append**:
   - **Static Array**: It's not possible to append a new element to a static array because its size is fixed. Hence, this operation is not applicable (N/A).
   - **Dynamic Array**: Appending an element to the end of a dynamic array has an average time complexity of \( O(1) \). However, in cases where the array needs to be resized (when the array is full), the time complexity is \( O(n) \) for copying elements to the new array.

5. **Delete**:
   - **Static Array**: It's not possible to delete an element from a static array because its size cannot be changed. Hence, this operation is not applicable (N/A).
   - **Dynamic Array**: To delete an element from a dynamic array, it may be necessary to shift the remaining elements to fill the gap, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

## Conclusion

- **Static Array**: Suitable for situations where the array size is fixed and known in advance. The main advantage of static arrays is fast access speed with a time complexity of \( O(1) \).
- **Dynamic Array**: Suitable for situations where the array size may change during program execution. Dynamic arrays offer more flexibility than static arrays at the cost of higher complexity for insert, append, and delete operations.
