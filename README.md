## Introduction

DSA-java is a collection of Java code that demonstrates the implementation of common data structures and algorithms used in computer science. It serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in understanding and practicing these concepts.

## Data Structures

The repository currently includes the following data structures:

- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph

Each data structure is implemented in Java and comes with detailed explanations and examples.

## Algorithms

The repository also covers a variety of algorithms, including:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
- And more!

Each algorithm is implemented in Java and accompanied by explanations and sample code.

## Contributing

Contributions to DSA-java are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional data structures/algorithms to add, please feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing code style and include appropriate tests.
